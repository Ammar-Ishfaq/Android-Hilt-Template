## Usage 📝

This project template provides a structured approach to building Android applications using Hilt for dependency injection and MVVM architecture pattern. You can customize and extend it according to your specific requirements. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Network Requests**: Use Retrofit for making network requests. Define your API endpoints and services using Retrofit interfaces.

- **Dependency Injection**: Utilize Hilt for dependency injection. Define your modules and components to manage dependencies across your application.

- **MVVM Architecture**: Follow MVVM architecture pattern to separate concerns and make your code more maintainable. Utilize ViewModel and LiveData to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

- **Clean Code Architecture**: Organize your code into layers such as presentation, domain, and data. Use packages to separate concerns and maintain modularity.

- **Jetpack Compose Navigation**: Use Jetpack Compose Navigation for navigating between composables. Define your navigation routes and screens in the navigation graph.

- **XML-based UI**: This project template uses XML for defining UI layouts. Utilize XML layout files to create user interfaces using standard Android views and widgets.
